lpsd.c
  ExpMinusOne subfunction for accurate computation of "exp(x)-1" in Eqn. 15
  bugfix: segment stepping cond. uses inequality: while(start + nfft <= nread)
  added the variable 'segOffset' under getDFT(), getDFT2() funcs
  added MAX(), MIN() macros to be used with int type
  getDFT(), getDFT2() round down seg. offset: MAX( 1,floor(ndft-ndft*ovlp/100) )

lpsd.c
  use the exact formula in Eqn 15 instead of the approx. one for r'(j) ( fresa )
  changed the '>' operator to '>=' for fres calc. in calc_params()
  bugfix: LR==0 condition was incorrectly set a=1.0 in remove_drift2()
